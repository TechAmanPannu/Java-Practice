public class Lambda {

    // Introduction:
    // 1. It helps in iterate, filter and extract data
    // 2. It helps to concise the way to represent method interface
    // 3. It is used to provide implementation of functional interface and it saves lot of code
    // 4. we dont need to define methods again for providing the implementation, using lambda we just have to write implementation.
    // 5  It is treated as function, so compiler does not create .class file


    // Use Cases:

    // 1. For implementing functional interface
    // 2. For Less coding
    // 3. We can use lambda implementation of interface method and avoid anonymous class
